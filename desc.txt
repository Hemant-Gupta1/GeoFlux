    GeoFlux: Advanced GIS for Soil Erosion Analysis – Designed a 
    high-accuracy system leveraging Landsat 8 imagery, 
    CHIRPS precipitation data, SRTM DEM, and machine learning to 
    predict soil erosion risks and track land cover changes over time. 
    Integrated advanced remote sensing techniques, cloud masking, and 
    key indices like NDVI, slope, and soil erodibility to create detailed
     risk maps; achieved classification accuracies of 90.8% (2015) 
     and 89.9% (2020).
    Key Contributions – Led geospatial algorithm development, 
    integrated multi-source remote sensing data with 
    machine learning models, and developed intuitive visualizations 
    to empower policymakers in effective erosion management and 
    sustainable land-use practices.
