# GeoFlux: Advanced GIS for Soil Erosion Analysis

GeoFlux is a sophisticated Geographic Information System (GIS) designed to predict soil erosion risks and monitor land cover changes over time. This project leverages multi-source remote sensing data, advanced machine learning techniques, and cloud masking to provide high-accuracy risk assessments, empowering policymakers with the tools needed for effective erosion management and sustainable land-use practices.

## Introduction

GeoFlux was developed to address the growing need for accurate soil erosion prediction systems. By integrating Landsat 8 imagery, CHIRPS precipitation data, SRTM DEM, advanced remote sensing techniques, cloud masking, and machine learning models, GeoFlux provides detailed risk maps with classification accuracies of 90.8% for 2015 and 89.9% for 2020. The system utilizes key indices such as NDVI, slope, and soil erodibility to create precise risk maps, aiding policymakers in making informed decisions for sustainable land-use management.

## Features

- **High-Accuracy Predictions**: Achieved through the integration of Landsat 8 imagery, machine learning models, and cloud masking.
- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Combines remote sensing data from various sources for comprehensive analysis.
- **Advanced Remote Sensing Techniques**: Integrated NDVI, slope, and soil erodibility indices for detailed risk mapping.
- **Intuitive Visualizations**: Developed to assist policymakers in making informed decisions.
- **Detailed Risk Mapping**: Provides soil erosion risk maps for effective erosion management.

## Installation

To install GeoFlux, clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure all required datasets are available in the respective folders.
2. **Run Analysis**: Execute the scripts to perform soil erosion risk analysis.
3. **Visualization**: Use the provided tools to generate visualizations for the results.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Running the Code

1. **Locate the Code File**:  
   Navigate to the project folder.
   Choose the folder corresponding to the desired year (e.g., 2015).

2. **Open code.txt**:  
   Inside the selected folder, you'll find a file named `code.txt`.  
   Open this file using a text editor.

3. **Copy the JavaScript Code**:  
   Select all the code within `code.txt` and copy it to your clipboard.

4. **Open Google Earth Engine**:  
   Visit the [Google Earth Engine platform](https://earthengine.google.com/) in your web browser.  
   Ensure you are logged in with your Google account.

5. **Access the Script Area**:  
   On the left panel, click on the "Script" tab to access the script area.

6. **Paste the Copied Code**:  
   Inside the script area, paste the copied JavaScript code.  
   Review the code for any specific parameters that may need customization.

7. **Run the Script**:  
   Click on the "Run" button within the script area.  
   This will execute the code in the Google Earth Engine environment.

8. **Monitor the Console**:  
   Keep an eye on the console for any errors or progress messages.  
   The console will display information about the script execution.

9. **Wait for Output**:  
   Depending on the complexity of the analysis, the script may take some time to run.  
   Wait patiently for the process to complete.

10. **View the Output**:  
    Once the script finishes running, you can visualize the output directly in Google Earth Engine.  
    Explore the layers and maps generated by the script to observe the Land Use Land Cover analysis or change detection results.

## Data Sources

- **Landsat 8 Imagery**: Used for land cover analysis.
- **CHIRPS Precipitation Data**: Provides precipitation information.
- **SRTM DEM**: Digital Elevation Model for slope analysis.

## Results

GeoFlux achieved classification accuracies of **90.8%** for 2015 and **89.9%** for 2020, demonstrating its effectiveness in soil erosion risk prediction. The integration of advanced remote sensing techniques, cloud masking, and machine learning models contributed significantly to generating detailed risk maps that support informed decision-making.
